# Usage
`./compile.sh <dir/file> [<dir/file2> ...]` will output the compiled config file.

# Compiled
A compiled version built from all included modules can be found on CBRO: [Nornya.rc](http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/rcfiles/crawl-git/Nornya.rc)

# Modules
Various modules are included. You can use them all by including the `modules` directory as an option to `compile.sh`, or you can selectively include them like `./compile.sh modules/skill_menu.txt modules/Nornya/base ...`
